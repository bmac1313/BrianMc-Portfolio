Hi!

This site is for my Data Analytcis studies completed while pursuing my Masters of Science in Advanced Data Analytics with a concentration in Management at the University of North Texas. I previously earned an undergraduate degree in Geography from Texas A&M University. I was born and raised in Texas and enjoy working here as a Consultant in the Geo-spatial Technology industry.

I can be reached at BrianMcNamara\@my.unt.edu
